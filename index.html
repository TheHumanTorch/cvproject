   			<p> August 2014 – October 2014 (University Of Greenwich, London) I was tasked to video and audio record the performances of Lectures and speakers during the 2014 Digital Research in the Humanities and arts conference which was held in the University of Greenwich. Guest speakers would come and deliver their research ideas and creative projects to the audience with explanation.
